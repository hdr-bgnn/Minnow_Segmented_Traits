# Data Processing

- combined with <a href = "https://github.com/hdr-bgnn/minnowTraits/blob/main/Files/Image_Metadata_v1_20211206_151152.csv"> Image Metadata</a>
- removed adipose fin presence/absence because minnows don't have that fins

# Preliminary Results

- only 40 images have at least one missing trait
- 2439 images have all traits found
- Created heat maps of:
  - average blob size of the largest blob of images within a species
  - standard deviation of blob sizes of images within a species
